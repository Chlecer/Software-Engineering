## Introduction

Welcome to the README for [APIs vs. Frameworks](support/apis-vs-frameworks.md), [gRPC Remote Procedure Calls](support/grpc-remote-procedure-calls.md), [OSGi - Open Service Gateway Initiative](support/osgi-open-service-gateway-initiative.md), and [Web Technology Relationships](support/web-technology-relationships.md). 
In these documents, we explore various aspects of modern software development, technologies, and concepts that are essential for developers and technology enthusiasts.

### APIs vs. Frameworks

In the [APIs vs. Frameworks](support/apis-vs-frameworks.md) document, we delve into the fundamental differences between Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Frameworks. Discover when and why to use one over the other and how they impact software development.

### gRPC Remote Procedure Calls

The [gRPC Remote Procedure Calls](support/grpc-remote-procedure-calls.md) document provides insights into gRPC, a high-performance RPC framework developed by Google. Learn about its purpose, how it works, real-world applications, and its significance in modern distributed systems.

### OSGi - Open Service Gateway Initiative

Explore the world of modularity, versioning, and dynamic deployment with the [OSGi - Open Service Gateway Initiative](support/osgi-open-service-gateway-initiative.md) document. Understand what OSGi is, its core concepts, and how it addresses common challenges in Java application development.

### Web Technology Relationships

The [Web Technology Relationships](support/web-technology-relationships.md) document uncovers the intricate connections between web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular web frameworks. Gain a deeper understanding of how these technologies complement each other in creating web applications.

Each document offers valuable insights and knowledge tailored to its respective topic. Whether you're a developer, a technology enthusiast, or simply curious about these subjects, we invite you to explore the details within each README.

Feel free to navigate to the document of your choice and start your journey into the world of APIs, frameworks, RPC, modularity, and web technologies.
