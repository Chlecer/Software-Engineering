# Microservices and Monolithic are types of software architecture

Monolithic Architecture: In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. All components, functions, and services are tightly integrated within a single codebase and are deployed together. This traditional approach is simpler to develop and test but can become complex and difficult to scale as the application grows.

Microservices Architecture: Microservices architecture breaks down an application into smaller, independently deployable and manageable services, often referred to as microservices. Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with other microservices through well-defined APIs. This approach promotes scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance but can introduce challenges related to inter-service communication and management.

Both architectures have their own set of advantages and challenges, and the choice between them depends on factors such as the nature of the project, the development team's preferences, scalability requirements, and more.
